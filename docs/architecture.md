## Core Components

### 1. Network Traffic Capture

- **Real-time capture**: Uses Scapy for live packet analysis
- **PCAP processing**: Supports offline analysis of packet captures
- **CSV import**: Capable of analyzing pre-processed network data

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Statistical features**: Connection duration, packet size distribution, etc.
- **Protocol features**: TCP flags, HTTP methods, DNS queries, etc.
- **Temporal features**: Traffic patterns over time
- **Connection features**: Source/destination IP, ports, connection states

### 3. AI Detection Engine

The system uses a two-tier detection approach:

#### Traditional Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest classifier for anomaly detection
- Support Vector Machines for attack classification
- Isolation Forest for outlier detection

#### Deep Learning Models
- LSTM networks for sequence analysis
- Autoencoders for anomaly detection
- CNN for pattern recognition in packet payloads

### 4. Analysis & Classification

- **Anomaly scoring**: Quantitative measurement of deviation from normal behavior
- **Attack classification**: Identification of specific attack types
- **Confidence assessment**: Probability estimation of detection accuracy

### 5. Alert Management

- **Prioritization**: Risk-based alert ranking
- **Deduplication**: Grouping related alerts
- **Enrichment**: Adding context from external threat intelligence
- **Notification**: Email, SMS, dashboard alerts

### 6. Response System

- **Manual response**: Tools for security analyst intervention
- **Automated responses**: Configurable actions based on alert type and severity

### 7. Reporting & Visualization

- **HTML reports**: Detailed incident information
- **Network visualization**: Traffic patterns and attack paths
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface
- **Metrics**: System performance and detection statistics

## Data Flow

1. Network traffic is captured or imported from PCAPs/CSV files
2. Raw traffic is processed by the feature engineering module
3. Extracted features are fed into the AI detection engine
4. Detected anomalies are classified by attack type
5. Alerts are generated with severity ratings
6. Automated responses are triggered based on configuration
7. Reports and visualizations are generated

## Storage

- **Models**: Trained models stored in the `models/` directory
- **Configuration**: YAML-based system configuration
- **Logs**: Detection logs for analysis and audit
- **Reports**: Generated HTML reports stored in the `results/` directory

## Integration Points

- **SIEM systems**: Alert forwarding to Security Information and Event Management tools
- **Firewalls**: Automated rule updates based on detections
- **Threat intelligence**: API integration with threat feeds
- **Network equipment**: Via SNMP or APIs for response actions

## Scalability Considerations

- Distributed processing for high-traffic networks
- Sampling techniques for extremely high-volume environments
- Model optimization for resource-constrained environments
- Hierarchical deployment for enterprise networks
